1. I have completed implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete operations. 
2. One thing I feel as a mistake I have done is I have used AUTO_INCREMENT for id instead of manually providing it.
3. GUI is not that interactive, I have developed everything in a single HTML file, which I feel I could've done better.
